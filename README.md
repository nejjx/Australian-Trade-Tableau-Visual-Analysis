Tracks percentage changes in import/export values relative to 1988 across all categories.  
- Category 0 (Food & Live Animals) showed significant growth and fluctuations  
- Categories 2 & 3 dominated exports (crude materials, fuels)  

### 🍖🥕 Dashboard – Meat vs Vegetables  
Interactive dashboard compares two key subcategories:  
- Meat exports: high contributor, volatile over years  
- Vegetables/fruits: stable, resilient during financial downturns  
- Shows economic sensitivity by subcategory  

### 📦 Statistical Breakdown  
Stacked area charts and treemaps reveal subcategory proportions within exports/imports:  
- Meat and cereals dominate food exports  
- Imports are more evenly distributed (fish, miscellaneous foods lead)  

### 💲 Raw Dollar Trends  
Area charts depict income/expenditure in millions:  
- Export values consistently outpaced imports  
- High-value exports in meat and cereals  

### 🧩 Storyboard – Subcategory Drivers  
Narrative-style storyboard combines all insights:
